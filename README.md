LilyBin
=======

[original project](https://github.com/LilyBin/LilyBin).

The goal of this fork is to add an additional scripting layout.

Lilypond is fine for printing, but I search to create something more
'algorithmic', 'math friendly'.


TODO:

Maybe add later some synthesis support with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) ??
